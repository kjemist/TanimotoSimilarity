### Calculate Tanimoto similarity from CSV-files using RDKit
This script calculates the Tanimoto score between two sets of molecules, given as SMILESs-strings.

Remember to:
- Define template and comparison csv file path below.
- In template, enter SMILES which you want to be the starting point of your comparison
- In comparison, enter SMILES which you want to compare with the the template set
- Make sure the first row has "SMILES" as a header
